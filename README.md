#### Framework Evaluation

It can be clearly seen that PHP is the best choice for this final project. PHP is much easier and more convienient to delever a product in less than 5 days. I have more experience with it than all of other web-development tools. It would be more fun to do the project with MEAN or VUE, but they are more risky duerin the installation and developing phases.
